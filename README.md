# skillmap

The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim inspired skill constellation prototype built with Vue 3, Vite, Pinia, and Tailwind CSS. Data is stored locally via Service Worker + OPFS; no external backend service is included.

## Getting started

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev           # launches Vite dev server on http://localhost:5173
```
Data is kept entirely in the browser (Service Worker + OPFS). There is no API server to run.
